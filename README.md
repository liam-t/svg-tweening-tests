# SVG Tweening Tests
**Live preview [here](https://liam-t.github.io/svg-tweening-tests/).**

Some experimentation into tweening between SVG paths.
Using [Popmotion Pose](https://github.com/popmotion/popmotion) and [Flubber](https://github.com/veltman/flubber) with React.

This example shows a play/pause button toggle animation with both *multiple to single object* and *single to multple object* transitions.
